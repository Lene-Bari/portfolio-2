        <p>
          Hi! I'm <strong>LeneBari Dum Samuel</strong>, also known as <strong>Heis_Bariâš¡</strong> â€” a passionate and
          creative web developer and graphics designer. I'm currently a student at <strong>Topfaith Legacy College,
            SC2A</strong>, with a deep love for technology, design, and innovation. I specialize in crafting clean,
          responsive websites using HTML and CSS, and I'm always pushing myself to learn more and build better.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dream? To create powerful platforms that connect people and change lives â€” just like Mark Zuckerberg did.
          Whether it's coding a sleek portfolio, designing a bold logo, or building the next big thing in tech, I'm all
          in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's build something amazing together!
